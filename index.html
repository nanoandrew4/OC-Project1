			<div class="left_div_section">

					<br />
					I am a 19 year old self taught programmer, currently employed as a Backend developer. I started programming in Java when I was 14 years old, and then started learning c++ a year later. I have
					worked on many projects over the years, solo and with a team, to further my skills and develop
					a portfolio. I am also an oboe and saxophone player, having been playing the former for almost five years, and the latter for over a decade. As of late, I have increasingly grown interested in machine learning, as well as high performance computing, both of which I have been developing some of my latest projects around.

					<h3>Ricoh IT Services</h3>

						<em>Backend Java Developer</em>
						<br /><br />
						Worked on a project for <strong>Dia%</strong> to migrate and improve
						their APIs. Development included fixing critical
						security flaws which I discovered during development, improving the
						authentication system, implementing new
						endpoints to provide a mobile checkout experience, among
						many other tasks. The development followed Agile
						methodologies, in order to continuously deliver value to
						the client, and included creating automated tests for
						all endpoints using Postman, in order for the QA team to
						rapidly verify the integrity of the APIs.
